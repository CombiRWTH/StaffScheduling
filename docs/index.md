# Welcome to Staff Scheduling Documentations

We are happy to have you here! You can find answers to all your questions within this documentation, which is divided into two distinct views: the [**User View**](/user-view) and the [**Developer View**](/developer-view).

If you are primarily interested in using and testing the Automatic Staff Scheduling system, you'll find all the important information in the [User View](/user-view) without delving too deeply into technical details. On the other hand, if you wish to contribute to or further develop this project, be sure to check out the [Developer View](/developer-view).

Please note that as a user, you can always dive deeper into the technical details, and as a developer, you are welcome to revisit the general concepts whenever needed.

## Usage

Currently, our application lacks a user-friendly interface for comfortably managing configurations. Instead, these settings are stored in a JSON file, which requires manual editing to make any changes.

### Vacation Days

Vacation days are an essential aspect of employee management, allowing organizations to track and manage time off effectively. In our application, vacation days are primarily set in TimeOffice.

In the full version of our application, vacation days are documented alongside forbidden days in the file located at `cases/{case_id}/free_shifts_and_vacation_days.json`. This file is automatically generated and includes entries for each employee with information about their scheduled time off.

The JSON structure for an employee's vacation days appears as follows:

```json
{
    "firstname": "Sandra",
    "forbidden_days": [
    18,
    22,
    23,
    24,
    25
    ],
    "key": 459,
    "name": "Shoemake",
    "planned_shifts": [],
    "vacation_days": [
    2,
    3,
    4,
    5,
    6,
    7,
    8,
    9,
    10,
    12
    ]
},
```

In this example, the `vacation_days` array lists the specific dates on which the employee is scheduled to be on leave. Users can easily modify this list by locating the relevant entry for each employee within the JSON file and adjusting the `vacation_days` array accordingly.

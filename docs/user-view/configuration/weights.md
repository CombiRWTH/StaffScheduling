### Weights Configuration

<div style="background-color: #ffcc00; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
    <strong>Warning:</strong> Please note that the weights assigned to objectives must not be greater than or equal to 1.
</div>

In our application, users can adjust the importance of various objectives within the general objective function to optimize scheduling and resource allocation. This configuration is managed in the `srs/solve.py` file.

The objectives are defined as follows:

```python
objectives = [
    FreeDaysNearWeekendObjective(10.0, employees, days),
    MinimizeConsecutiveNightShiftsObjective(2.0, employees, days, shifts),
    MinimizeHiddenEmployeesObjective(100.0, employees, days, shifts),
    MinimizeOvertimeObjective(4.0, employees, days, shifts),
    NotTooManyConsecutiveDaysObjective(MAX_CONSECUTIVE_DAYS, 1.0, employees, days),
    RotateShiftsForwardObjective(1.0, employees, days, shifts),
    MaximizeEmployeeWishesObjective(3.0, employees, days, shifts),
    FreeDaysAfterNightShiftPhaseObjective(3.0, employees, days, shifts),
]
```

Each objective is assigned a weight represented by a numerical value (e.g., `10.0`, `2.0`, etc.). By changing these numbers in the codebase, users can effectively prioritize specific objectives according to their operational needs and preferences.

Currently, our application lacks a user-friendly interface for comfortably managing configurations. Instead, these settings are stored in a JSON file, which requires manual editing to make any changes.

#### Forbidden Days

Forbidden days are designated by TimeOffice as days when an employee is not permitted to work, except during vacation periods. These days are typically marked with a cross in the TimeOffice system.

In the full version of our application, forbidden days and vacation days are read from the database and stored in the file `cases/{case_id}/free_shifts_and_vacation_days.md`. This file is automatically generated and contains an entry for each employee in the following format:

```json
{
      "firstname": "Burkhild",
      "forbidden_days": [
        1,
        2,
        3,
        4,
        5,
        6,
        28,
        29
      ],
      "key": 7796,
      "name": "Hertzler",
      "planned_shifts": [],
      "vacation_days": []
}
```

Within this JSON structure, you can easily modify the list of forbidden days, which indicates the specific dates on which an employee is not allowed to work. To update these settings, simply locate the relevant entry for each employee and adjust the `forbidden_days` array as needed.

# Documentation - User View
The developer view is a extension of the user view. It provides all necessary information to use our application, to understand how we used Google's OR Tools to solve the problem of automatic staff scheduling, to dive deep into the structure of the TimeOffice database and to get an overview of our codebase before you start contributing.

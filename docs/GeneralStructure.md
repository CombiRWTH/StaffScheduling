# General Structure

This document describes the overall structure and purpose of the components in this project.

## Core Entry Point

### `solving.py`
This is the **main script** for solving the scheduling problem.  
It defines and initializes the model, adds constraints, and calls the solver.  
All constraint logic is built up here by calling helper functions.

---

## Constraint Modules

### `building_constraints/`
This folder contains the **implementation** of various constraint-building functions.

Each file defines a specific type of constraint:
- `initial_constraints.py`: basic structure like "one shift per employee per day"
- `free_shifts_and_vacation_days.py`: time-off and unavailability
- `target_working_hours.py`: enforces target working time with tolerance
- `minimal_number_of_staff.py`: (optional) under development

Note: These files **implement constraint logic**, not case-specific data.

---

## Output Handling

### `handlers.py`
Defines how the solution is **handled after solving**, including:
- Printing to console
- Saving to JSON
- Plotting (planned)

Currently, there's one unified handler class that supports **multiple output modes**, though not all are fully implemented yet (`print`, `plot`, `json`).

---

## Plotting (WIP)

### `plotting.py`
Contains functions for **visualizing the solution** (e.g., Gantt charts or shift tables).  
This is **not yet fully implemented**, but planned to allow human-readable views of schedules.

---

## Global Program State

### `StateManager.py`
Contains a global `state` object used to store runtime-shared data.  
Currently, it's used to track which constraints have been added.  
Useful for handlers (e.g., saving metadata like applied constraints).

---

## Test Cases

### `cases/`
Holds different **example scenarios** (folders named by `case_id` like `1/`, `2/`, ...).  
Each folder contains:
- Employee definitions
- Constraint settings
- Target working hours
- Time-off requests

This allows easy switching between different planning situations.

#### `case_catalog.md`
Markdown overview of all defined test cases, explaining their purpose and setup.

---

## Documentation

### `docs/`
Contains supporting documentation:
- `GeneralStructure.md`: this file
- `Constraints.md`: list of all constraints, one of the most important files
- `Images/`: optional folder for diagrams or screenshots

---

## Found Solutions

### `found_solutions/`
Automatically created folder to store output JSON files with solved schedules, based on the selected case and time of solving.

---

## Misc

- `.gitignore`: Standard Git ignore rules.
- `README.md`: Project overview and usage instructions.

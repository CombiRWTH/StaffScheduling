## How does this all work?

To help you understand how our codebase works, you need to understand what we did,
how we formulated the problem and which tools we used to solve it. With problem
we mean the automatic creation of a staff schedule which meets all given conditions.

We answered those question and many more here:

- problem statement
- mathematical problem formulation
- constraints
- objectives
- database
- visualization
